# Scrum notes

## What is Scrum?

2 minute video introduction:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRcReyRYIMg

Problems in complex projects:

* organising the team
* changes in scope
* unclear roles

Scrum is a framework for Agile work.

1. Product owner creates a prioritised backlog.
2. Sprint planning session takes a few from the top of the backlog and decides how best to complete it.
3. The sprint itself is a set time-frame to complete the work.
4. Daily 'Scrum' meetings (led by 'Scrum Master') to keep things moving in the right direction.
5. Sprint results in 'potentially shippable' product.
6. Review of product.
7. Retrospective on process.

Chooses (2) next chunk of the backlog.

## The Scrum Guide

Guidelines to the fundamentals of Scrum.
https://www.scrumguides.org/docs/scrumguide/v2017/2017-Scrum-Guide-US.pdf

By Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland.

### Purpose of the Scrum guide

To define the Scrum framework.
In particular to define:-
* roles
* events
* activities

in the context of Scrum and to make rules for how they interact.

### Definition of Scrum

Scrum is a specific high-level framework for organising, evaluating and improving the processes used to solve a problem.

Scrum is designed to work for complex problems that might require continuous adaptation at the same time as being simple to get started with.

### Uses of Scrum

Scrum is claimed to be especially effective for transferring knowledge as part of an iterative process.

Scrum is intended to be carried out by a small group of people.
This small group could be free-standing or part of a large network of teams.

### Scrum theory

Scrum advocates creating knowledge based on outcomes of previous decisions.
A short feedback loop makes it easier to control risks.

The process must:-
* be transparent to those in positions of responsibility
* involve frequent inspection of artefacts and progress
* adapt quickly when going off course

### Scrum values

1. commitment
2. courage
3. focus
4. openness
5. respect

The rough idea seems to be that by adhering to these values the team can become more effective than the sum of its parts.

### The Scrum team

1. product owner
2. the development team
3. Scrum Master

* self-organising: internally decide how to approach problems
* cross-functional: team contains all required skills 

#### The product owner

Is a single person responsible for maximising value.

By managing the product backlog the product owner should express desiderata clearly and with a priority.
The product owner should ensure that the development team understands the backlog items.

#### The development team

Aim to create a 'potentially releasable increment of a product' at the end of each sprint.
The development team is self-organising and cross-functional as described above.
It contains neither a hierarchy nor an internal structure of any kind.

##### Development team structure

Generally 3-9 people (only includes Scrum Master and product owner if they are working on the sprint backlog).
The exact number is a balance between:
* being small enough to maintain flexibility
* being large enough to contain all desired skills

#### The Scrum Master

The Scrum Master implements and maintains the practice of Scrum.
This includes managing interactions outside the Scrum team.

The Scrum Master therefore provides a service to:-
* the product owner
	* helps to convert ideas and goals to the Scrum framework
* the development team
	* helping to achieve cross-functionality and self-organisation
* the organisation
	* leading and coaching Scrum adoption

### Scrum events

Scrum prescribes certain events:-
* create regularity
* reduce need for meetings
* are a formal opportunity to enable transparency and inspection

All the events have a maximum duration.

#### The Sprint

A container event.
Duration of one month or less.
Aims for: a 'done' usable and potentially releasable product increment.

1. Sprint planning
	* 8 hours for a one month Sprint
	* what can be delivered?
	* how will the work be achieved?
	* should result in the sprint goal
2. daily Scrums
3. the development work
4. Sprint review
5. Sprint retrospective

The Sprint is a contract that prevents work contrary the the Sprint goal and requires that quality goals do not decrease.
A Sprint may only be cancelled by the Product Owner.
It would be unusual but may happen if the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete.

##### Daily Scrum

A 15 minute time-boxed event intended only for the development team.
Used to inspect progress.
Example questions:

* what did I do yesterday towards the Sprint Goal?
* what will I do today towards the Sprint Goal?
* can I see any future impediment to meeting the Sprint Goal?

Detailed discussions may *follow* the daily Scrum.

##### Sprint review

At most 4 hours and includes not only the Scrum team but other stakeholders also.
The purpose is to review the actual development work and backlog.
* What was done and what was not.
* What went well and what did not.
* The development team answers questions about the increment.
* What to do next?

##### Sprint retrospective

At most three hours.
The purpose is to evaluate the processes, relationships and tools used.
Then plan how to implement improvements.

### Scrum Artefacts

#### Product Backlog

Items on the Product Backlog should have:-
* description (perhaps even descriptions of tests)
* order (responsibility of the Product Owner)
* estimate (responsibility of the development team)
* value
It is reviewed at least every Sprint review.

#### Sprint Backlog

The items selected for the Sprint as well as a plan to complete these items.
Must include one high priority process improvement identified in the retrospective.
This is modified throughout the Sprint.
This is reviewed by the development team in the Daily Scrum.

#### Increment

All of the items already completed.
At the end of a Sprint the new Increment must be 'done'.
The purpose is that this completed work may be used as empirical evidence for future work.

### Artefact transparency

Since decisions are made on the the Scrum artefacts they must be transparent.
(I.e. clear to everyone especially those responsible for the product.)

#### Definition of 'done'

May vary between teams but should be clear within teams.
Usually this means that the result of a Sprint should be releasable by the Product Owner.
